		<h3>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</h3>
		
		<p>The position of this job is Systems Administrator at Commonwealth Bank Australia. The description states that the employee will be a Flightdeck 
		Systems Administrator who is in charge of providing 24/7, 365 support of application, systems infrastructure and physical facilities such as Data Centres. 
		The Systems Administrator is the primary conduit for the distribution of the operational and monitoring activities across the services provided by the Commonwealth 
		Bank and incorporation of the said activities with other operational teams.
		<br>
		This position is appealing to me as it involves a series of tasks which will need to be completed using different monitoring tools. It is also appealing as it uses different 
		types of software and tools which I haven’t used before, which allows me to learn more and gain an additional skill set. This role also enables me to learn how to apply these
		technologies to the needs and wants of a different industry. Within the  job description the Commonwealth Bank encourages you to find additional support through the HR Direct 
		where you can find help for accessibility issues. This allows me in particular to be comfortable in applying for the job as it outlines the support for accessibility issues, if
		any were to come about for myself on the site and also in person.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
</h3>
		<p>The skills and experience needed to be a suitable candidate for this job include; being able to work with incident management procedures and processes, within an enterprise environment. 
		They also ask to have experience in monitoring in a 24/7 NOC/Operations Centre environment as well as having problem solving skills to undergo customer support under a high-pressure environment. 
		Experience for the role also includes the use of many software and monitoring tools including; working on cloud-based technologies and virtualisation, use monitoring tools such as HP Site Scope, 
		SCOM, HP Insight, App Dynamics, Splunk, Solar Winds and use script such as Bash, PowerShell and Python.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.
</h3>
		
		<p>The current skills I have been able to acquire are being able to install and use operating systems such as Microsoft and Mac and undergoing level 1 and 2 helpdesk support. This in turn involves  
		the help desk ticket system, networking such as LAN and WAN connections and IP addresses and how to use an active directory created on a virtual server.
		
		<p>I have received my qualification through the two years of being at Miller Tafe through the three certificates, especially the Diploma of Information Technology. It has given me the qualification 
		to be an IT support person wherever needed.
		
		<p>I have no current experience in an IT job but have completed practical work and assessments during Tafe with ease, which include networking, active directory, help desk support. I also have some 
		personal experience with setting up a remote network for my parents on their laptops as they have their own business. Through my Facebook business page, I have built gaming computers for friends and 
		set up the operating system ready for use. With an array of experience I believe that an opportunity at this role will allow me to develop the knowledge and further skills needed to achieve my ultimate 
		job for the future. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		
		
		<h3>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now.</h3>
		<p>My ultimate goal is to become a Systems Administrator. To do this, I would need to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology degree. With the completion of Introduction in Information Technology, 
		I hope to gain confidence and communication skills while working collaboratively within a team. This in the long term,  will give me the skills to be able to work with others and speak up when there may 
		be issues.The next step would be to complete a course in ‘Introduction in Programming’ and gain the skills to be able to code especially ‘Python’ being that it is a required skill for the job. Another step
		would be to learn about monitoring tools and cloud-based technologies through other relevant courses and how they add to the work of a Systems Administrator at the Commonwealth Bank Australia.</p>
