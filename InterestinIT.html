		<h2><u>Interest in IT</u></h2>
		<br>
		<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
</h3>
		
		<br>
		<p>My interest in IT started when I received my first laptop at the age of 10. It was used mostly for games and watching movies 
		but then I started to become more interested in IT when I had to set up the new router for the family at home and assist 
		grandparents with their IT needs. These encounters began my search within IT and the different aspects that make up the 
		industry. Today I have an understanding of networking and level 1 and 2 help desk support due to the Diploma in Information
		Technology, which was completed at Miller Tafe in 2019. I have also established a Facebook page to start a small side business 
		called AB.IT, offering my expertise to help friends and others with IT issues which will in turn help me gain the experience I 
		need to further my understanding with varying technologies which are constantly changing and updating over time. As my father has
		his own joinery  business, I am also assisting with remote settings to allow them to work from home on the weekends. I have also been 
		able to set up laptops for cousins to use for their schooling.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>I chose RMIT as I saw it as an opportunity to gain experience and work collaboratively with others as you would in a workplace, who are 
		learning and interested in the same subject area. As the Bachelor of Information Technology is online at RMIT, it helps to be able to study
		from home as I have a disability. On that note there is a lot of support available when it comes to getting started in the course and throughout.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>During my studies I expect to learn the aspects of IT such as networking and help desk support, which make up the industry and gain the skills and work
		ethic to undergo many technological challenges that may arise. I am looking to become a systems administrator in the long term, so with the knowledge gained
		from this course I hope to shape and fulfil that future goal. My interests in troubleshooting, help desk, installing and organising computer systems as well
		as setting up LAN and WAN networks and some programming. This will help me gain some of the skills and experience to become a step closer to the future job.</p>
