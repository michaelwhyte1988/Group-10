<h3>The group members have the following Briggs-Myer profiles:</h3>
<br>
<p>
	1: Conrad is  INTP- A <br>
	2: Aldo is ISFJ-T <br>
	3: Michael is ISTP-T <br>
	4: Lucas is  ENFP-T <br>
	</p>
	<br>
<h3>In our team we have the following traits </h3> <br>
	3 introverts, 1 extrovert <br>
	2 sensing, 2 intuition <br>
	2 thinking, 2 feeling <br>
	3 perceiving, 1 judging <br>
	30% Auditory, 30% Auditory <br>
	40% Visual, 35% Visual <br>
	30% Tactile, 35% Tactile <br>
	
	
</p>	
<br><h3>Differences between profiles</h3>	
	<br>
	<p>
		Introvert: reflective, quiet, focused, inner world, measured, think then speak, solitude. 
		Extrovert: active, hearty, variety, interested in the outer world, expressive, speaks as they think, social. As there are introverts and extroverts within the group,
		we both work well by ourselves and with each other and learn from the differences present and focus on the long-term goals of a project. Both different personalities have their own strengths, some involving thinking strongly,
		making strategic decisions as well as solving complex issues that may arise.
		Sensing vs Intuition: our team has 50% of those that are daydreaming while about the others are getting things done in present

	<h3>How this information is useful for a team work setting</h3>
	<br>
	<p>
		This information is useful as it gives an indication of the personalities of the individual group members to then form a more compatible team. 
		This allows all members to easily understand each other and how each member works to be able to work in the most efficient way possible. Within the team work setting, 
		productivity will also be improved as members can communicate potential strengths and weaknesses and work out a strategy to achieve the goal they are trying to reach.
		Learning styles are also relevant within the team work setting as everyone is different in the way they learn whether it be auditory, visual, or tactile, so that each member of the team can work in their best possible way.
