		<h2><u>Clouds, services, servers  </u></h2>
		<br>
		<h2>What does it do? </h2>
		
		<br>
		<p>Cloud, services and servers sums up the infrastructure behind a cloud environment. We call it the cloud as we don’t see it however all it is,
		is just servers physically located elsewhere usually in datacentres and generally managed by cloud practitioners however still has all the physical 
			items you would normally see in an on prem environment.  </p>
				<br>
				
				<br>
				<p>State of the art when it comes to cloud technology is pretty much down to a few key areas;  

Redundancy- In terms of networking, every link has a redundant path to go through so if one fails another one can take the load, this is achieved through different network topologies and routing protocols.  

Network- The backbone of how fast the information can travel through from server to client, at the moment we are up to 100Gbps however we are always limited to choke points along the way.  

Latency- Current connection speed to server/s, this is increased by improving networking protocols and also different cloud locations closer to each region. 

Backup Technology -RAID levels,  

Fail over - Today we are able to have failover clustering so that if something falls over i.e. a server shuts down, it is able to migrate clients to the other server so that the clients don’t even realise an outage had occurred. 

Physical limitations – RAM speeds, HDD Size and speed, GPU and CPU limitations 

Elasticity- With cloud servers, it’s all about only using what you need, with elasticity you can make it so that the environment grows as you need it. You are allocated or pay for what you need and if your systems need more it grows to suits those needs.
  

At the moment you have a choice between PAAS, SAAS, IAAS, in the future I don’t see the models changing from this however the underlying security, speed and reliability will all increase making these platforms more attractive to businesses of the future.  

You will have more data centres across the globe and faster backbone which means information will be able to be accessed quicker and more securely. 

Quantum computing will transform the business world like never before. Companies like Google are leveraging the principles of quantum physics to make breakthroughs by developing next-generation products for the end users. 

Automation helps business organizations improve their productivity without spending too much time and effort. The automation tools available to us have proved to be very important when it comes to addressing errors in business processes, meanwhile streamlining them to generate fruitful results. 

The serverless paradigm is the next revolution in waiting, according to the CTO of Amazon. The concept of serverless paradigm relates to the fact that it facilitates cloud to execute a code snippet without any hassles for the developers. 				
				</p>
				<br>
			<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>	
						
		<br>
				<p> 

With the introduction to cloud technology it will mean less overhead for companies. They will be able to concentrate more on what they need to do to succeed. Companies will no loner need to pay for expensive IT infrastructure or hire security experts to make sure everything is secure and backed up properly. They can rest assured that all of their data is backed up, secure and highly available.  

With more and more people moving to cloud based solutions you will most likely see a better carbon footprint across the globe as data centres will be more responsible with how the are able to cool their datacentres and are held to higher standards in this regard.  

 

The only changes that are most likely to happen would be better security, faster equipment, faster network speeds, less server downtime if any at all, more interoperability with vendors.  

 

  

This will affect anyone utilizing cloud services in a good way. They won’t have to deal with the changes themselves from a physical standpoint however they will get all the benefits. They will see over time the latency to their information will be lightning quick and that they are able to access it at anytime without any issue. Most of the changes the users won’t see as most of it will happen without them knowing. The only way it could affect them is if legacy systems aren’t supported anymore and certain applications were made for those systems.  

 

I don’t think it will make anyone redundant however IT professionals coming from working in an on prem only environment will need to upskill in vendor specific (AWS or Azure) in order to maintain a job in the sector. 

Legacy systems will always survive however they will mostly become obsolete with the introduction of virtualisation. You can run multiple different OS through virtualisation.  					
			<br>
				<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
							
		<br>				
<p>Cloud computing will affect everyday people whether they realise it or not. In my daily life I work in the IT field and most of us use cloud services to do our work.  

With suites like google G-suite and Microsoft Office 365, these offer a SAAS Solution that many people use today.  

Backing up to OneDrive or other cloud providers allows your information to be securely and readily available wherever you are on whatever device you are using.  

As things evolve people need to adapt, technology evolves so quickly and if they don’t go with the technology then they may lose their jobs and livelihood.  

In the future I won’t need to purchase a really expensive computer to play high grade games. I will be able to rent as part of a subscription, a virtual machine hosted on a cloud server close by to play any game at any time.  

At home most homes will be smart from the get go, firealarms will be linked with your router as well as door bells, security cameras and everything will be easily monitored and activated from your phone through the use of cloud technologies.  

This will help the elderly be able to be at home by themselves and know that if something happened to them that they would be able to get the help they need in time.  

All in all, the future of cloud computing is going to help everyone in a great way, the more we invest in it the better our planet will be as information becomes readily 
available and quicker to access. It will mean third world countries will be able to receive the same information as any other country and the ability to learn can all 
come from a regular smart phone as everything will be hosted from cloud services. </p>

<h2><u> Arduino </u></h2>
<br>
<h2>What does it do? </h2>
<br>
<p>
	The Arduino is an open-sourced electronics platform based on easy to use hardware and software. Arduino boards are made to be able to read inputs such as lights on a sensor, a finger on a button and turn into an output such as activating a motor, turning on an LED.
	Arduino over the years has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to scientific instruments. 
	A major worldwide community of makers such as students, artists, programmers and professionals, have gathered in this open-source platform to add their contributions to a set of accessible knowledge that can be of help to other experts.
	The Arduino simplifies microcontrollers for students, teachers and amateur programmers as it is: Inexpensive - Arduino boards are comparably inexpensive than other competitor microcontroller platforms. 
	Cross-platform - The Arduino Software (IDE) runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and linux, whereas other microcontrollers are limited to Windows. Simple, clear programming environment - Easy to use for beginners but flexible enough for advanced users and programmers to take advantage of the board and students to learn in an easy, familiar environment as it is easy to work the Arduino.
	Open source and extensible software - The Arduino software is published as an open source tool. 
	The language can be expanded through C++ and people can also make the change from Arduino to AVR C programming language. Open source extensible hardware - Experienced circuit designers can make their own versions of the board, extending and improving it. 
	Arduino products allow one to code online on the Arduino Web Editor, Install Arduino Desktop IDE and learn Arduino. There are many different types of Arduino products such as boards, starter kits, enhanced boards, as well as education hardware and software tools.
	Examples of what can be created with the Arduino board include; building a tiny weather display system, Robotic arm, Fully functional computer 
	control panel, a fingerprint scanner for your garage door opener, etc. The Arduino will allow businesses to develop products tobe able to upgrade further down the line. For example a product such as a microwave, there is no way to change the functionality but with the Arduino board, the interface can be changed for the way in which you prefer things to be cooked. 
	The Arduino in the future is going to allow developing countries to create and do things in which they couldn’t in the past. This may include medical devices and low-cost PLC controllers and is going to open a whole host of options and capabilities for medicine and manufacturing in places where regulation is not demanding. 
	Microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms such as Parallax Basic Stamp, Netmedia’s BX-24, Phidgets, MIT’s Handyboard are some technologies which offer functionality of the Arduino. These devices take the details of microcontroller programming and make it into an easy to use IT technology. The Arduino language which is C++, has a lot of abstraction built in, especially within the hardware interfaces which makes it very easy to use. 
	Arduino uses its own software (Integrated Development Environment), which makes it easy to write code and upload to the board. 
	The software environment is written using Java and based on other-open source software.
</p>
<br>
<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>
<p>
	Arduino products have not necessarily changed the way things are done but have made microcontrollers more accessible and visible to the public.  “I do believe that the Arduino has helped drive a resurgence of the Maker culture which, in turn, is helping to drive people back to a reuse, repair and repurpose mentality” (Benefield, P John). Arduino isn’t an innovation but allows for many innovations within society to be created and ultimately continue to change the future of IT technologies and robotics.
	Arduino will most likely have changed the look and feel of the device itself but can also have the software changed as well. This in turn will create more opportunities for new devices to be made through the already used C++ code on the Arduino IDE software, as developers are programming. Students and teachers may be affected as Arduino has made it easy to learn with the current hardware and software products to create a more hands on experience with students and programming. 
	When new Arduino products are created it will offer a more advanced learning for the students and teachers in the future and create more opportunities to increase skills.
	This IT technology will make jobs available for freelancers and professional programmers. Some jobs include C programmer, which looks for someone who can code with C++ as well as a Programmer Writer who focuses on programming Raspberry Pi’s and especially Arduinos. Although there are some jobs which involve programming and working with Arduino products, there is still a chance to make a job of it as programming the device could be part of another job and give you the skills to help get a job.
</p>

<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
<br>
<p>   
	The Arduino can affect my daily life as the Arduino can be used for various roles, which in turn will create many opportunities to be able to create everyday or new projects. The technology is inexpensive and easy to acquire, which allows for easy access to new skill sets as it also allows for multiple opportunities with what can be created and programmed. This can lead to new opportunities for jobs as the use of the Arduino board is close to unlimited with how it can be used and programmed.
	 The skillset currently acquired can be expanded as the Arduino gives you lots of information when it comes to programming, as well as basic knowledge of hardware.
	 There is not much else that is different for myself as Arduinos are not something in which I am working at the moment. However once completing a programming course I am sure it will begin to become easier to understand and program an Arduino board for many projects or as a hobby. 
	 This might affect members of the family slightly, as the family business is joinery work, making boardroom tables which are made through a production line. If the Arduino can be made to create robotics which can take over a production line this will affect the jobs of the workers and family as no one is needed to make the furniture within the business.

<h2><u>Cybersecurity</u></h2>
<br>
<h2>What does it do? </h2>
<br>
<p>
	Cybersecurity is a practice of protecting systems and networks from digital attacks and information theft. Put simply a cyberattack will come from a black hat hacker using script to create things such as ransomware, phishing, malware, or social engineering. As we all use the internet whether it be on a mobile device or a computer we your data can be stolen unless you are prepared to take some precautions by using a Virtual Private Network or ‘VPN’ along with a reputable antivirus and internet security software package. Some of the industry leaders are Norton, AVG, McAfee or Kaspersky.
	We could also consider operating system’s as some might be more secure than others. The main players are Apple and Microsoft whilst very user friendly could be considered the most vulnerable. Recently I purchased a Raspberry Pi with NOOBS runs on Linux. I was surprised to learn Linux is considered a safer OS due to its flexibility.
	How data privacy has been considered for both individual and enterprise has many looking at what is considered the Fifth realm of warfare. As such governments around the world are trying to exploit weakness therefore the cutting-edge technologies are coming from the defence forces. It was not until 2018 when the EU implemented the GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation that is becoming a business standard around the world.
	Cybercrime will be forever evolving however in the upcoming years needs to begin at an individual level, what are you prepared for the world to know or see about your personal details and governments becoming more accountable for protecting our data. This also includes every company that requires us to store data on their servers to use their products.
	</p>
<br>
<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>
<br>
<p>
	As companies drive innovation and technology advances consumers will become the beneficiaries. This could come at a cost unless action is taken. Already we are using home hubs or smart appliances, although these devices do not store personal data, they do however pose a risk, as these are connected to the internet and could serve as a conduit for hackers.
	During COVID-19 there have been more people working from home and using enterprise platforms there has been a spike in cybersecurity breaches.
	If you consider today's problems will be resolved by tomorrow's minds. The cybersecurity industry is experiencing a fore nominal growth and will create many jobs which is also a wonderful thing at this current time of high unemployment. However, as technology advances such machine learning you might think a demand for humans to combat cybercrime would be in decline.  Yet according to Andy Bocham (2019, p18)“ If your com­pany has not suffered a serious cyber incident, the notion of disconnecting as much as pos­si­ble, installing old-­ fashioned mechanical devices, and inserting humans ­ in automated functions might sound like a regressive business decision. Instead it should be reframed as a proactive risk-­ management decision.`
	It is going to take governments to make policies that increase digital security and hold corporations accountable on how they handle our data. There are already so many compliance frameworks in business currently that mitigate risk. Corporations need to become more proactive, not just reactive. Until such time unfortunately we will continue to stay in a passive cyber-defence world. I would liken it to the search for world peace.
</p>
<br>
<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
<br>
<p>
	As I currently have Norton360 installed on all devices, However I now see this aspect of security as drop in the ocean in comparison to the other layers of protection required. I have always taken an Ad hoc approach to internet security and if I am suggesting corporations should become proactive steps will need to be taken.
	Cybersecurity is a very steep learning curve and there is an abundance of online article, yet it will take some time with research and learning, and it was pleasing to find it is a growing sector in the IT industry.
	There will need to be some time spent looking at firewall settings to ensure the whole family has protection and a spring clean on our cyber-hygiene
