		<h2><u>Clouds, services, servers  </u></h2>
		<br>
		<h2>What does it do? </h2>
		
		<br>
		<p>Cloud, services and servers sums up the infrastructure behind a cloud environment. We call it the cloud as we don’t see it however all it is,
		is just servers physically located elsewhere usually in datacentres and generally managed by cloud practitioners however still has all the physical 
			items you would normally see in an on prem environment.  </p>
				<br>
				
				<br>
				<p>State of the art when it comes to cloud technology is pretty much down to a few key areas;  

Redundancy- In terms of networking, every link has a redundant path to go through so if one fails another one can take the load, this is achieved through different network topologies and routing protocols.  

Network- The backbone of how fast the information can travel through from server to client, at the moment we are up to 100Gbps however we are always limited to choke points along the way.  

Latency- Current connection speed to server/s, this is increased by improving networking protocols and also different cloud locations closer to each region. 

Backup Technology -RAID levels,  

Fail over - Today we are able to have failover clustering so that if something falls over i.e. a server shuts down, it is able to migrate clients to the other server so that the clients don’t even realise an outage had occurred. 

Physical limitations – RAM speeds, HDD Size and speed, GPU and CPU limitations 

Elasticity- With cloud servers, it’s all about only using what you need, with elasticity you can make it so that the environment grows as you need it. You are allocated or pay for what you need and if your systems need more it grows to suits those needs.
  

At the moment you have a choice between PAAS, SAAS, IAAS, in the future I don’t see the models changing from this however the underlying security, speed and reliability will all increase making these platforms more attractive to businesses of the future.  

You will have more data centres across the globe and faster backbone which means information will be able to be accessed quicker and more securely. 

Quantum computing will transform the business world like never before. Companies like Google are leveraging the principles of quantum physics to make breakthroughs by developing next-generation products for the end users. 

Automation helps business organizations improve their productivity without spending too much time and effort. The automation tools available to us have proved to be very important when it comes to addressing errors in business processes, meanwhile streamlining them to generate fruitful results. 

The serverless paradigm is the next revolution in waiting, according to the CTO of Amazon. The concept of serverless paradigm relates to the fact that it facilitates cloud to execute a code snippet without any hassles for the developers.

			<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>	
						
		<br>
				<p> 

With the introduction to cloud technology it will mean less overhead for companies. They will be able to concentrate more on what they need to do to succeed. Companies will no loner need to pay for expensive IT infrastructure or hire security experts to make sure everything is secure and backed up properly. They can rest assured that all of their data is backed up, secure and highly available.  

With more and more people moving to cloud based solutions you will most likely see a better carbon footprint across the globe as data centres will be more responsible with how the are able to cool their datacentres and are held to higher standards in this regard.  

 

The only changes that are most likely to happen would be better security, faster equipment, faster network speeds, less server downtime if any at all, more interoperability with vendors.  

 

  

This will affect anyone utilizing cloud services in a good way. They won’t have to deal with the changes themselves from a physical standpoint however they will get all the benefits. They will see over time the latency to their information will be lightning quick and that they are able to access it at anytime without any issue. Most of the changes the users won’t see as most of it will happen without them knowing. The only way it could affect them is if legacy systems aren’t supported anymore and certain applications were made for those systems.  

 

I don’t think it will make anyone redundant however IT professionals coming from working in an on prem only environment will need to upskill in vendor specific (AWS or Azure) in order to maintain a job in the sector. 

Legacy systems will always survive however they will mostly become obsolete with the introduction of virtualisation. You can run multiple different OS through virtualisation.

				<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
							
		<br>				
<p>Cloud computing will affect everyday people whether they realise it or not. In my daily life I work in the IT field and most of us use cloud services to do our work.  

With suites like google G-suite and Microsoft Office 365, these offer a SAAS Solution that many people use today.  

Backing up to OneDrive or other cloud providers allows your information to be securely and readily available wherever you are on whatever device you are using.  

As things evolve people need to adapt, technology evolves so quickly and if they don’t go with the technology then they may lose their jobs and livelihood.  

In the future I won’t need to purchase a really expensive computer to play high grade games. I will be able to rent as part of a subscription, a virtual machine hosted on a cloud server close by to play any game at any time.  

At home most homes will be smart from the get go, firealarms will be linked with your router as well as door bells, security cameras and everything will be easily monitored and activated from your phone through the use of cloud technologies.  

This will help the elderly be able to be at home by themselves and know that if something happened to them that they would be able to get the help they need in time.  

All in all, the future of cloud computing is going to help everyone in a great way, the more we invest in it the better our planet will be as information becomes readily 
available and quicker to access. It will mean third world countries will be able to receive the same information as any other country and the ability to learn can all 
come from a regular smart phone as everything will be hosted from cloud services. </p>
