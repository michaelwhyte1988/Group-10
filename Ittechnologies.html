		<h2><u>Clouds, services, servers  </u></h2>

		<h2>What does it do? </h2>
		
		<br>
		<p>Cloud, services and servers sums up the infrastructure behind a cloud environment. We call it the cloud as we don’t see it however all it is,
		is just servers physically located elsewhere usually in datacentres and generally managed by cloud practitioners however still has all the physical 
			items you would normally see in an on prem environment.  </p>
				<br>
				
				<br>
				<p>State of the art when it comes to cloud technology is pretty much down to a few key areas;  

Redundancy- In terms of networking, every link has a redundant path to go through so if one fails another one can take the load, this is achieved through different network topologies and routing protocols.  

Network- The backbone of how fast the information can travel through from server to client, at the moment we are up to 100Gbps however we are always limited to choke points along the way.  

Latency- Current connection speed to server/s, this is increased by improving networking protocols and also different cloud locations closer to each region. 

Backup Technology -RAID levels,  

Fail over - Today we are able to have failover clustering so that if something falls over i.e. a server shuts down, it is able to migrate clients to the other server so that the clients don’t even realise an outage had occurred. 

Physical limitations – RAM speeds, HDD Size and speed, GPU and CPU limitations 

Elasticity- With cloud servers, it’s all about only using what you need, with elasticity you can make it so that the environment grows as you need it. You are allocated or pay for what you need and if your systems need more it grows to suits those needs.
				</p>

			<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>

				<p>
What is the potential impact of this development?  

With the introduction to cloud technology it will mean less overhead for companies. They will be able to concentrate more on what they need to do to succeed. Companies will no loner need to pay for expensive IT infrastructure or hire security experts to make sure everything is secure and backed up properly. They can rest assured that all of their data is backed up, secure and highly available.  

With more and more people moving to cloud based solutions you will most likely see a better carbon footprint across the globe as data centres will be more responsible with how the are able to cool their datacentres and are held to higher standards in this regard.  

 

The only changes that are most likely to happen would be better security, faster equipment, faster network speeds, less server downtime if any at all, more interoperability with vendors.  

 

  

This will affect anyone utilizing cloud services in a good way. They won’t have to deal with the changes themselves from a physical standpoint however they will get all the benefits. They will see over time the latency to their information will be lightning quick and that they are able to access it at anytime without any issue. Most of the changes the users won’t see as most of it will happen without them knowing. The only way it could affect them is if legacy systems aren’t supported anymore and certain applications were made for those systems.  

 

I don’t think it will make anyone redundant however IT professionals coming from working in an on prem only environment will need to upskill in vendor specific (AWS or Azure) in order to maintain a job in the sector. 

Legacy systems will always survive however they will mostly become obsolete with the introduction of virtualisation. You can run multiple different OS through virtualisation.
