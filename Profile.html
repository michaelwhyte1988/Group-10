		<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>

		<br>
		<h3><u>Myers-Briggs Test</u></h3>
		<br>

		<br>

			<br>
			<br>
		<p>The Myers-Briggs test shows that I am a Defender. This to me means I am mostly introverted as I do not like social interactions too much, also due to the fact I have a disability I am
		not so comfortable around people I do not know. This is also evident as in my result, I am 75% turbulent, which means I am always worried about how others  perceive me.</p>

			<br>
			<br>

		<h3><u>Learning Style Test</u></h3>
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		<p>The results for the learning style test show me that I am a visual learner, this to me means that I need to see visuals to understand a reading or how to set up a networking device for example. 
		In IT, once I am shown how to do something, I make notes and am able to continue and complete the task with some practice.</p>
		
		
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h3><u>Creativity Test</u></h3>
		<br>
		<IMG src="ctest.jpg" width="50%" align="left" />

		
		<p>The third test conducted was the creativity test, which shows that I am 58% creative when it comes to concepts for different ideas. However, it also shows a lack of boldness as I am not so confident, 
		which goes with my introverted characteristics. Curiosity and perspective as well as abstraction shows that I am someone who wants to understand how things work and how they function to a more detailed level.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>

		<p>One of the results in the Myers-Briggs test shows that I am 58% introverted. This will influence my behaviour negatively as I am not someone who likes to chat with people I do not know. Once I get to know the team, 
		I will be a good member as I am observant, and a visual learner. Having the observant variant, shows that I am able to understand how to learn and understand how to work with others, as well as know how my skills will
		differ with others in the team and how they can benefit the team. These two traits show that I am capable of learning things quickly through the visual learning style I have found in the learning style test. When it comes 
		to creativity, I leave it for the group to decide on the main idea, as I’m not so creative, but I help with ways to add on and improve what the team has come up with.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
		
		<p>This should be taken into account as I may be a good member when it comes to observing specific aspects of a project  that the team might be working on. As I am introverted, 
		when forming a team it is best to have some people who are extroverts who will initiate conversation and include all members of the team in the project. Being  a visual learner,
		I will feel  comfortable working with others that are visual learners so we can learn and understand each other and the work on the same level. This will help the team as it is
		ensuring everyone is understanding the task at hand, making it easy to complete. When forming a team, it is best to have people with creativity, as I am not so creative, so we can
		bounce ideas off each other and come up with the best creative idea for a project.</p>
