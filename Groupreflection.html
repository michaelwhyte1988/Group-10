		<h2><u>Interview</u></h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h3>
		
		<br>
		<p>I am a Systems Administrator or Service Desk Analyst.
		This role simply put means that I ensure that the IT equipment the company uses runs as it should and that they have access to all of their IT systems 
		that they require. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Please tell us about the industry you work in. </h3>
		<br>
		<p>The industry I work in is very customer focused. We work off answering customers through phone, email or video calls. We gather the information that the customer 
		is having and we formulate that into a ticketing system. From then we use ITIL practises to ensure we effectively fix or escalate problems as they arise. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
				
		<h3>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Physical moves – We help people install their workstations in other areas of the office.
		Network Troubleshooting – We have 4 floors and multiple sites across the globe, we use Meraki dashboard to see the logical topology and at times we need to 
		troubleshoot the network side of things to ensure connectivity to the network is stable. 
		Project Management – At times we need to implement new systems which involve working together as a team to ensure these implementations are done correctly. 
		User Creations/ Terminations – When people come and go we need to ensure all their IT equipment and access has been finalised</p>
		<br>
		<br>
				
		<h3>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. </h3>	
		<br>	
		<p>I work for an IT company and need to interact with a lot of different IT professionals. 
		It was a bit of a learning curve as need to be able to convey things differently to other people in the same field however it makes things a lot easier when 
		you don’t need to baby sit them through the basic steps. 
		You can generally send them a “How to guide” and they will be able to do it themselves.
		IT may be one term however there are so many different jobs within it and with that many different personalities. Generally speaking, IT professionals 
		are helpful though some can be recluse at times which makes working within teams a little difficult.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
				
		<h3>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>	
		<br>	
		<p>My clients are internal to the company, so it is easy to build strong relationships with them. It is a large company however, so you are always 
		meeting new people. 
		Interactions with our clients can vary, you have a lot of people under stressful situations and when their IT equipment doesn’t work for the time 
		they need it they can be a bit forward however most of the time interactions are quite relaxed and easy going. 
		I can’t say we get to see the investors of the company that often. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
				
		<h3>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3>	
		<br>	
		<p>I spend most of my time going through our ticketing system and replying answers to questions from our clients, ensuring we follow ITIL time frames. 
		We work together to ensure that we keep constant communication back with our customers with their issues they are having, we also need to prioritize 
		tasks depending on the issue and severity of problem.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
				
		<h3>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3>	
		<br>	
		<p>The most challenging thing I find is new technologies, within IT things are always changing and evolving. Keeping up pace can sometimes be difficult.
		Trying to find time to learn these technologies can be hard. Though it keeps things interesting, IT is a career that doesn’t stay stagnant.</p> 							<p>
		<br>
		<br>
				
		<h3> Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3>
		<br>	
		<p>The other day we fixed a teleconference meeting with senior level executives from across the globe. They were having issues with audio. 
		We were on standby and figured out the issue behind it all, after we fixed it the meeting was able to go on smoothly and they were able to ensure 
		they achieved the targets they needed before end of financial year. This sums up the IT industry because most people don’t know they need us until
		they need us and then we don’t always get the recognition like other departments. IT industry like helping others achieve what they need to achieve.</p>							<p>
