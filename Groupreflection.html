		<p>Firstly what went well was the allocations of tasks within the assessment as well as allocation of HTML files to edit and create. What could be improved is the communication skills 
		as they were not as effective as they should have been. One thing that was surprising was the time in which we were able to allocate tasks quickly to be able to start working in 
		an efficient manner. One thing I have learned about groups is that it is hard to rely on members to be on at the same time and for a good amount of time and at the same time. It is
		easy in a group to fall behind and have to wait for members to complete allocated tasks, which in turn slows down the rest of the group. Github was well in keeping log of who added 
		information to the website. It shows the history of each html which is edited by multiple members to show where we are up to with the development of the webpage as well as who edited 
		the information and how many times it has been edited.</p>
