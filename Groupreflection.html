		<p>I feel the discussion on Canvas could have been better. As to the communication platform we used,I understand Discord is a very popular platform.
		However it highlights how communication and planning plays a vital part and gives all stakeholders some input when starting a project as a team. 
		There is nothing like being included and forming a plan first and foremost.It must be noted that having a central document with Google drive was clearly a great move and allowed everything to be simplified as to what each member of the team needed to complete prior to the transition to our Github repository. 
		I was surprised to see how good Github is with keeping track of a project of this nature. Everything on the collaboration front was slow to begin with, however once we could all be online things started to come together very quickly. It was pleasing to be able to ask other team members with a little more 
		knowledge than myself how certain aspects of coding worked.</p>

		<p>Firstly what went well was the allocations of tasks within the assessment as well as allocation of HTML files to edit and create. What could be improved is the communication skills 
			as they were not as effective as they should have been. One thing that was surprising was the time in which we were able to allocate tasks quickly to be able to start working in 
			an efficient manner. One thing I have learned about groups is that it is hard to rely on members to be on Discord (group-meeting software we used), talking to each other at the same
			time and for a good amount of time to get work done. It is easy in a group to fall behind and have to wait for members to complete allocated tasks, which in turn slows down the rest of
			the group. Github was well in keeping log of who added information to the website. It shows the history of each html which is edited by multiple members to show where we are up to with 
			the development of the webpage as well as who edited the information and how many times it has been edited.</p>

		<p>In our first assignment together as a team I think the things that stand out as a positive for this project was our communication when we were able to organize a time to work on it together. Breaking down the group project into parts and allocating to members as well as utilizing google docs to help collaborate at the same time or leave notes for each other was really handy. 
The things that could be improved perhaps moving onto our next assignment would be using a team communication application like Teams or Zoom as Discord isnâ€™t really set up the greatest for these types of projects. There are a lot of distractions with Discord as well as the limited functionality was a bit of a hindrance to get things done.
I found it surprising how hard it was to try and track members down to help with the assignment, we were unable to get onto one of our members towards the end and it made it more difficult for the rest of us to complete the assignment in time.
I have learnt that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses, the most important thing in groups is to plan early on the things that need to be done so that everyone can go and do their bits in their own time. 
Githubs log is a good tool to help monitor things that are being committed and to which location.
